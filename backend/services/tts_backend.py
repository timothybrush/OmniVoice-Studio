"""
TTS adapter interface — Phase 3.1 (ROADMAP.md).

A uniform protocol for every TTS engine. Today we ship:

    • OmniVoiceBackend — wraps the current k2-fsa/OmniVoice model. Zero
      behaviour change for existing callers.
    • VoxCPM2Backend   — thin stub that raises with a clear install hint
      until `pip install voxcpm` is present and enabled.

Callers should use `get_active_tts_backend()` to pick the configured engine
instead of importing a specific class. The selection is controlled by the
`OMNIVOICE_TTS_BACKEND` env var (default: `"omnivoice"`).

The protocol deliberately stays narrow: `generate(...)` returns a 1-channel
tensor sampled at `sample_rate`. Streaming is left for a later pass — the
dub generator consumes whole segments today.

# ── IndexTTS2 adapter ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The concrete class lives in ``backend/engines/indextts/__init__.py`` so
# that ``services.tts_backend`` itself does NOT import
# ``services.subprocess_backend`` at module load time. That separation
# breaks the import cycle:
#
#     services.subprocess_backend  ──imports──>  services.tts_backend (TTSBackend)
#     services.tts_backend         ──exports──>  TTSBackend + registry
#     engines.indextts             ──imports──>  services.subprocess_backend
#                                  ──exports──>  IndexTTS2Backend
#
# The registry below resolves IndexTTS2Backend lazily via the
# ``_LAZY_REGISTRY`` indirection — see ``get_backend_class`` and
# ``list_backends``. This was driven by Plan 02-03 (Step 3); see
# ``engines/indextts/__init__.py`` for the actual class body.


# ``IndexTTS2Backend`` is re-exported from ``backend/engines/indextts``
# via the module-level ``__getattr__`` hook at the bottom of this file
# (PEP 562). Callers can still write::
#
#     from services.tts_backend import IndexTTS2Backend
#
# and they receive the same class object as ``engines.indextts.IndexTTS2Backend``.
# The deferred lookup is what breaks the
# ``services.subprocess_backend ↔ services.tts_backend`` cycle.
