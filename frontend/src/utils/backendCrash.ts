/**
 * backendCrash — frontend bridge to the desktop shell's crash forensics
 * (#941, src-tauri/src/crash.rs).
 *
 * When the backend PROCESS dies (native CUDA abort, OOM kill, DLL crash) the
 * Rust death watcher persists a crash marker (exit code/signal + stderr tail).
 * This module reads it so:
 *   - api/client.ts can replace the vague "Can't reach the local backend"
 *     with the honest story,
 *   - components/BackendCrashNotice.jsx can offer "View crash details",
 *   - utils/bugReport.js can attach the evidence to the GitHub-issue prefill.
 *
 * Outside the Tauri shell (browser dev, Docker, LAN share) the getters fall
 * back to the BACKEND's own run-sentinel forensics (#1164,
 * backend/core/run_sentinel.py): GET /system/last-run-crash reports a
 * previous run that died without a clean shutdown, adapted here to the same
 * CrashMarker shape — so BackendCrashNotice, the apiFetch crash branch, and
 * the bug-report prefill light up in every deployment, not just desktop.

 * PROCESS went away underneath it. On smaller GPUs the usual trigger is running
 * out of VRAM while loading the ASR model on top of a resident TTS model, which
 * aborts the process natively rather than raising a catchable Python error.
 *
 * When the desktop shell recorded a crash marker (#941), say what actually
 * happened — exit code, how long ago, and the VRAM next step — and raise the
 * crash notice so "View crash details" is one click away. With no marker (or
 * outside the Tauri shell) the caller's own message stands.
